My research interests started with Helga Kolb's paper "[How the retina works](https://webvision.med.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2003-01Kolb.pdf)", the first paper my supervisor Mingliang Pu recommended. After that, I was deeply attracted by this delicate slim tissue and devoted myself to understanding its organization and function better. My personal recommended material about retina is the online textbook [WEBVISION](https://webvision.med.utah.edu/) maintained by Bryan Jones now. 

Echoes with Kolb's paper, the big question I am curious about is how the eye, especially the retina, samples visual scenes and encodes them into neural information. To uncover that, my current efforts and thoughts include:
1. **Sampling mechanisms of the retina**  
- Every animal species has its own distinct retinal cell distribution pattern, what the reason and function is? Some quanlitative descriptions of this exist, but quantitative consideration is still lacking.  
- A major difference between animal eyes from cameras is the non-uniform sampling, because perceiving rapidly is much more important than seeing clearly to animal survival. How can this rule inspire artificial designs?
2. **Retinal modeling**
- Retinal neuronal connections are ordered but complex. Connectomics can provide more comprehensive and precise observations. 
- Physiological recording of retinal neuronal activity through microscopy can provide wider observation fields and thus many novel insights.
3. **Efficient bio-image processing**
- Above researching techniques development promote data (image here) production, efficient processing pipelines are essential to converting images to knowledge (I2K).   
- I'd rather to take image processing as the "retina" of computational vision, which deals with raw data for later better understanding.
