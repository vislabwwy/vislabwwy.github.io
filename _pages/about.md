# This is Dr. Wenyao Wang's personal page. 

My research interests started from Prof. Helga Kolb's paper "[How the retina works](https://webvision.med.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2003-01Kolb.pdf)", the first paper my supervisor Prof. Mingliang Pu recommended. After that I was deeply attracted by this delicate slim tissue and devoted myself to understanding its orginization and function better. My personal recommended material about retina is the online textbook [WEBVISION](https://webvision.med.utah.edu/) maintained by Prof. Bryan Jones now. 

Echoes with Kolb's paper, the big question I am curious at is that how the eye, especially the retina, sample visual scenes and encode them into neural information. To uncover that, my current efforts and thoughts include:
1. Sampling mechanisms of the retina  
- Every animal species has its own distinct retinal cell distribution pattern, what the reason and function is? Some quanlitatively descriptions about this exist, but quantitatively consideration is still lacking.  
- A major different of animal eyes from cameras is the non-uniform sampling, because perceiving rapidly is much more important than seeing clearly to animal survival. How can this rule inspire artificial designs.
2. Retinal modeling
- Retinal neuronal connections are ordered but complex. Connectomics can provide more comprehensive and precise observations. 
- Physiological recording of retinal neuronal activity through microscopy can provide wider observation field and thus many novel insghts.
3. High efficient bio-image processing
- Above researching techniques development promote data (image here) production, efficient processing pipelines are essential to converting images to knowledge (I2K).   
- Image processing itself is a branch of computational **vison** research.
